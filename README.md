Game-play:
- It is a chase and run game. User controls the predator by keyboard inputs and attempts to eat the flocker. User can move in all X, Y and Z directions. (4 arrow keys for 4 directions and 'G' and 'H' key for front and back direction respectively i.e. Z axis)
- There's a life bar for the predator which decreases continously with time.
- If the predator eats a flocker the score will increase along with the predator's life.
- The game is over when life-bar becomes 0.
